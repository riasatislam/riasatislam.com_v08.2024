**Design Thinking from an Islamic Perspective**

Design thinking is a problem-solving approach that emphasizes empathy, creativity, and innovation to create solutions that meet human needs. It revolves around understanding the user's perspective, iterating on ideas, and continually refining solutions to achieve the most effective outcomes. While design thinking as a formal methodology is relatively modern, its core principles can be traced back to Islamic teachings. In Islam, there is a focus on holistic problem-solving, ethical responsibility, and continuous improvement, all of which align with the key stages of design thinking.

In this article, we will explore the concept of design thinking from an Islamic perspective, highlighting how the principles of empathy, innovation, and social responsibility in Islamic teachings can provide a valuable foundation for this problem-solving approach.

### 1. **Empathy and Compassion: The Foundation of Human-Centered Design**

The first stage of design thinking involves developing empathy and understanding for the people who are facing a particular challenge. Designers must immerse themselves in the experiences of the users they are trying to serve, to gain insight into their needs, challenges, and aspirations. This human-centred approach aligns with the teachings of Islam, which emphasizes empathy, compassion, and caring for others.

In the Quran, Allah (SWT) says:
> وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَـٰكَ إِلَّا رَحْمَةًۭ لِّلْعَـٰلَمِينَ  
> "And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds" (Quran 21:107).

The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was sent as a mercy to all of humanity, embodying empathy and compassion in his interactions with others. His approach to problem-solving was grounded in understanding the needs of people, whether they were his companions, strangers, or even adversaries. He listened attentively to their concerns, demonstrated kindness, and worked to find solutions that were beneficial for everyone.

For instance, when the Prophet (PBUH) established the Constitution of Madinah, he took into account the diverse needs of the various tribes and religious groups in the city. He demonstrated empathy by ensuring that the rights of all groups, regardless of their faith, were protected and that peace and coexistence were maintained. This example reflects the essence of human-centred design in Islam: understanding the context, addressing people's needs, and ensuring that solutions are just and compassionate.

### 2. **Ideation and Creativity: Fostering Innovation with Purpose**

Once the user’s needs are understood, the next step in design thinking is ideation, where creative solutions are generated to address the identified challenges. Islam encourages creativity and innovation, but it also emphasizes that innovation should be purposeful, ethical, and beneficial for society.

Islamic teachings emphasize *ijtihad*—the process of independent reasoning used by scholars to address new issues that arise in society. This concept reflects the importance of thinking critically and creatively within the framework of Islamic ethics. Throughout Islamic history, scholars have used *ijtihad* to innovate and adapt to changing circumstances, always ensuring that their solutions align with the principles of justice, mercy, and the common good.

In a Hadith, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said:
> وَلا يُؤْلَفُ وَخَيْرُ النَّاسِ أَنْفَعُهُمْ لِلنَّاسِ  
> "The best of people are those who bring the most benefit to others" (Al-Mu’jam Al-Awsat).

This Hadith highlights the importance of creating solutions that serve others and improve their well-being. In design thinking, ideation is not just about generating creative ideas—it is about generating solutions that bring real value to people’s lives. From an Islamic perspective, innovation should always be aligned with ethical considerations and should aim to serve humanity and bring benefit to society.

### 3. **Prototyping and Testing: Continuous Improvement in Light of Islam**

After generating ideas, the next stage in design thinking involves prototyping and testing solutions. This process involves building early versions of a product or service, receiving feedback, and refining the solution until it meets the users' needs. This iterative process aligns with the Islamic principle of continuous improvement (*ihsan*).

The concept of *ihsan* encourages Muslims to strive for excellence in all aspects of life. In the Quran, Allah (SWT) commands believers to perfect their actions and continuously work toward improvement:

> وَأَحْسِنُوٓا۟ ۛ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ  
> "Indeed, Allah loves those who act with excellence" (Quran 2:195).

The idea of continually refining and improving solutions, as emphasized in design thinking, is mirrored in Islamic teachings. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) demonstrated this principle in various aspects of his life. For example, in his leadership, he constantly sought feedback from his companions, refined his strategies, and adapted to new challenges to ensure the best outcomes for the community. He encouraged others to embrace a growth mindset, where learning from mistakes and improving upon them is valued.

An example of this is found in the battle of Uhud, where the Prophet (PBUH) learned from the mistakes made during the battle and adapted his approach to future military engagements. This process of trial, feedback, and improvement reflects the importance of prototyping and testing in design thinking, as well as the principle of seeking continuous improvement in Islamic ethics.

### 4. **Collaboration and Community: Co-Creation and Shura**

Design thinking is inherently collaborative. Solutions are developed through brainstorming, feedback, and teamwork. In Islam, the concept of *shura* (mutual consultation) plays a significant role in decision-making and problem-solving. The Quran emphasizes the importance of consulting others in matters of importance:

> وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَجَابُوا۟ لِرَبِّهِمْ وَأَقَامُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَأَمْرُهُمْ شُورَىٰ بَيْنَهُمْ  
> "And those who have responded to their lord and established prayer and whose affair is [determined by] consultation among themselves..." (Quran 42:38).

The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) regularly consulted with his companions when making important decisions. He valued their input and created a collaborative environment where ideas and solutions could be co-created. This collaborative spirit is central to design thinking, where diverse perspectives are brought together to develop more effective solutions.

For example, during the construction of the trench in the Battle of the Trench, the idea to dig a trench around Madinah came from Salman Al-Farsi (RA), one of the companions of the Prophet. The Prophet welcomed the idea and worked with the community to implement it. This approach of involving others in the decision-making process, listening to their ideas, and building solutions together is central to both *shura* in Islam and co-creation in design thinking.

### 5. **Ethical Responsibility: Aligning Innovation with Islamic Values**

A key aspect of design thinking is ensuring that the solutions being developed are ethical and responsible. In Islam, ethics and morality are fundamental principles that must guide all actions and decisions. Every innovation and solution must be evaluated in light of Islamic values, ensuring that it is not harmful to individuals, society, or the environment.

The Quran says:

> وَلَا تُفْسِدُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ بَعْدَ إِصْلَـٰحِهَا  
> "And do not cause corruption upon the earth after its reformation" (Quran 7:56).

This verse serves as a reminder that any solutions or innovations must not lead to harm or corruption. Whether designing a product, developing technology, or solving social issues, the Islamic perspective demands that the process be grounded in ethical responsibility. Design thinking, when aligned with Islamic ethics, ensures that the solutions created are not only effective but also just, fair, and beneficial to all.

### Conclusion

Design thinking, with its emphasis on empathy, creativity, and iterative problem-solving, resonates deeply with Islamic principles. From the Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) approach to leadership and consultation to the Quranic emphasis on continuous improvement and ethical responsibility, the core values of design thinking can be found within the teachings of Islam.

By adopting a design-thinking mindset grounded in Islamic principles, individuals can contribute to building solutions that serve humanity, foster compassion, and promote justice. This approach ensures that innovations are not only effective in solving problems but also aligned with the ethical and moral framework that Islam provides. Through empathy, collaboration, and a commitment to excellence, Muslims can engage in meaningful innovation and create lasting, positive change in the world.
