## The Importance of Networking, Connections, and Referrals in Hiring

In my opinion, after the alignment of values (you can read more about that in my previous post [https://riasatislam.com/blog/values-alignment/]), the second most important factor in hiring or securing a job is the strength of connections, networking, and referrals. 

At **GTAF.org**, we highly value recommendations from people within our trusted network. In fact, there are instances when we don’t publicly advertise job openings. Instead, we hire through internal recommendations from trusted, competent individuals in our network. This approach is not exclusive to us; many job openings globally go unadvertised and are filled through referrals.

### So how can you tap into these unadvertised jobs?

The answer is simple: **Build connections. Network, network, and network.** It’s crucial to establish relationships with people and exchange favours with them. Attend events, meet new people, and nurture your existing network—whether it’s family, friends, relatives, or alumni. Don’t hesitate to reach out to people kindly, and in most cases, you’ll find them willing to help. Many people "pay it forward" for the favours they received along the way.

### Networking Helps Even for Publicly Advertised Roles

Connections matter even when jobs are advertised publicly. When there are hundreds of applicants, how do recruiters filter out the best ones? Sure, they look at merit, but realistically, time constraints often lead them to prioritize applicants referred by trusted contacts. So, if you see an open job post that interests you, reach out to someone in your extended network who works in that organization. Believe me, finding the right candidate is not an easy task for companies, and many struggle to fill roles. 

At **GTAF.org**, I remember an instance where we had 5 or 6 candidates, all referred by people we trust. We interviewed each of them and ended up hiring the person whose values aligned best with our organization. 

### What if You’re Not Hired Immediately?

Even if we don’t hire someone immediately, we often keep promising profiles in mind for future openings. At **GTAF.org**, we have a **Future Prospects** section where we store information on potential candidates. We regularly follow up with them when new opportunities arise.

### Internships and Volunteering as Entry Points

For early career professionals, internships or volunteering can be excellent entry points. These positions often lead to full-time roles down the line. I’ll dive deeper into this topic in another post, but suffice to say that volunteering and internships provide a pathway to demonstrate your skills and commitment to a company.

### Conclusion

To summarize, after aligning with values of an organisatio; connections, networking, and referrals are the second most important factors in securing a job. In my own experience, I’d say that 4 out of the 5 jobs I’ve had in life came through my personal connections, *bi ithnillah*.

So go ahead—start networking, build those connections, and see how they can open doors to opportunities you may not even know exist. You won't know unless you have tried.
