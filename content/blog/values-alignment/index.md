# What is the key to hiring and building a team?

Alhamdulillah, at [gtaf.org](https://gtaf.org), we've been working together for 9 years and have gradually built up our team. Today, we have around 30 team members across the UK, Malaysia, and Bangladesh.

We’ve faced challenges and made mistakes along the way. As a nonprofit, it’s not always easy to match market salaries or big tech remuneration. But Alhamdulillah, with these limitations, Allah has put _barakah_ (blessing) in our team.

After several interviews and time on the hiring side, one thing has become clear: the single most important factor in building a successful team is **values alignment**.

Even the most capable candidate may not be a good fit if their values don’t align with the organization’s. On the other hand, when values do align, we can invest in capacity and skills development and get the best out of people.

Strong values alignment helps us build the right culture for our team and organization.

So, to future team members at GTAF and all job applicants, remember to highlight how you align with an organization’s values. This is the most important aspect of your application.
