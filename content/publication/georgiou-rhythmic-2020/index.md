abstract: 'Background: Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited genetic disorder that
  results in the death of brain cells. HD symptoms generally start with subtle changes
  in mood and mental abilities; they then degenerate progressively, ensuing a general
  lack of coordination and an unsteady gait, ultimately resulting in death. There
  is currently no cure for HD. Walking cued by an external, usually auditory, rhythm
  has been shown to steady gait and help with movement coordination in other neurological
  conditions. More recently, work with other neurological conditions has demonstrated
  that haptic (ie, tactile) rhythmic cues, as opposed to audio cues, offer similar
  improvements when walking. An added benefit is that less intrusive, more private
  cues are delivered by a wearable device that leaves the ears free for conversation,
  situation awareness, and safety. This paper presents a case study where rhythmic
  haptic cueing (RHC) was applied to one person with HD. The case study has two elements:  the
  gait data we collected from our wearable devices and the comments we received from
  a group of highly trained expert physiotherapists and specialists in HD. Objective:
  The objective of this case study was to investigate whether RHC can be applied to
  improve gait coordination and limb control in people living with HD. While not offering
  a cure, therapeutic outcomes may delay the onset or severity of symptoms, with the
  potential to improve and prolong quality of life. Methods: The approach adopted
  for this study includes two elements, one quantitative and one qualitative. The
  first is a repeated-measures design with three conditions: before haptic rhythm
  (ie, baseline), with haptic rhythm, and after exposure to haptic rhythm. The second
  element is an in-depth interview with physiotherapists observing the session. Results:
  In comparison to the baseline, the physiotherapists noted a number of improvements
  to the participant’s kinematics during her walk with the haptic cues. These improvements
  continued in the after-cue condition, indicating some lasting effects. The quantitative
  data obtained support the physiotherapists’ observations. Conclusions: The findings
  from this small case study, with a single participant, suggest that a haptic metronomic
  rhythm may have immediate, potentially therapeutic benefits for the walking kinematics
  of people living with HD and warrants further investigation.'
