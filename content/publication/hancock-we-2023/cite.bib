This paper draws on emergent findings of a UKRI-funded project (SENSE, EP/V042351/1) focusing on touch as a prime locus for children to explore the natural environment in their school grounds. With recognition of the decreasing levels of children’s exposure to the outdoors, this project critically explores the integration of two modes of touch (digital, natural) for children to make sense of and articulate their lived experiences. 

Methods
We conducted observations involving 302 children aged 6-12 across 10 primary schools in Scotland and England. Activities involved children using touch to explore natural objects (e.g. feathers, pinecones, leaves); interacting with new digital haptic (touch) technologies featuring textures from nature (e.g. tree barks, fur, scales); engaging in arts activities and exploring scientific questions around texture (e.g. why are some tree barks rough and others smooth?). Data were collected through photos, audio and video recordings, and observation notes. 

Main Findings
Emergent findings point to the complex and significant role of touch in integrating children’s exploration of the natural world with their communication and imaginative abilities. Evidence shows children using touch to make sense of familiar and unknown objects in new ways, supported by hand and facial gestures and the use of metaphorical language furthering new observations and new questions.

Conclusions
We argue that a focus on touch discloses the opportunities for children to develop personal connections with their environment and stimulate further inquiry. Drawing further attention to the significance of digital and natural touch as modes of learning in sustainability education, the (school) environment is offered as a ‘place’ for all children both to learn and belong.},
