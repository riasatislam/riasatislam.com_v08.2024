abstract: Aims This paper draws on emergent findings of a UKRI-funded project (SENSE,
  EP/V042351/1) focusing on touch as a prime locus for children to explore the natural
  environment in their school grounds. With recognition of the decreasing levels of
  children’s exposure to the outdoors, this project critically explores the integration
  of two modes of touch (digital, natural) for children to make sense of and articulate
  their lived experiences.   Methods We conducted observations involving 302 children
  aged 6-12 across 10 primary schools in Scotland and England. Activities involved
  children using touch to explore natural objects (e.g. feathers, pinecones, leaves);
  interacting with new digital haptic (touch) technologies featuring textures from
  nature (e.g. tree barks, fur, scales); engaging in arts activities and exploring
  scientific questions around texture (e.g. why are some tree barks rough and others
  smooth?). Data were collected through photos, audio and video recordings, and observation
  notes.   Main Findings Emergent findings point to the complex and significant role
  of touch in integrating children’s exploration of the natural world with their communication
  and imaginative abilities. Evidence shows children using touch to make sense of
  familiar and unknown objects in new ways, supported by hand and facial gestures
  and the use of metaphorical language furthering new observations and new questions.  Conclusions
  We argue that a focus on touch discloses the opportunities for children to develop
  personal connections with their environment and stimulate further inquiry. Drawing
  further attention to the significance of digital and natural touch as modes of learning
  in sustainability education, the (school) environment is offered as a ‘place’ for
  all children both to learn and belong.
