abstract: Global warming has become the greatest problem of the world in the last
  few decades. Many efforts have already been made in some international treaties,
  but due to many limitations the success achieved so far is very minimal. The whole
  civilization depends on industrialization, which is making the environmental scenario
  worse day by day because of unavailability of green technology. Industrialization
  is important but Trading off between the carbon emission reduction and industrialization
  is more challenging task in hand. Though the developing nations are less industrialized
  and emitting less carbon, but they are suffering more for environmental degradation.
  The whole world has seen the developing nations being victimized by the tsunami
  disaster recently. To fight this situation, the whole world is looking for sustainable
  green technology in all sectors. This paper presents an idea of installing more
  nuclear power plants in developing nations to reduce carbon emission. Technical
  feasibility of building nuclear power plants has been proved and prioritizing energy
  sector over other sectors to implement green technology has been justified. Economic
  feasibility of the proposal has also been proved from the statistics and global
  governance and monitoring system has been proposed to overcome global skepticism
  about building nuclear power plants.
