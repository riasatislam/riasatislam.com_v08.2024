 abstract = {Global warming has become the greatest problem of the world in the last few decades. Many efforts have already been made in some international treaties, but due to many limitations the success achieved so far is very minimal. The whole civilization depends on industrialization, which is making the environmental scenario worse day by day because of unavailability of green technology. Industrialization is important but Trading off between the carbon emission reduction and industrialization is more challenging task in hand. Though the developing nations are less industrialized and emitting less carbon, but they are suffering more for environmental degradation. The whole world has seen the developing nations being victimized by the tsunami disaster recently. To fight this situation, the whole world is looking for sustainable green technology in all sectors. This paper presents an idea of installing more nuclear power plants in developing nations to reduce carbon emission. Technical feasibility of building nuclear power plants has been proved and prioritizing energy sector over other sectors to implement green technology has been justified. Economic feasibility of the proposal has also been proved from the statistics and global governance and monitoring system has been proposed to overcome global skepticism about building nuclear power plants.},
