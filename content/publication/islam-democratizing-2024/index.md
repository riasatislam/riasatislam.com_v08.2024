abstract: This study evaluated the versatility of the MoJoXlab in conducting clinical
  movement analysis using inertial sensors from various manufacturers, including low-cost,
  non-proprietary, and open-protocol wearable options. Data were collected from 15
  healthy participants who performed a range of clinically relevant activities and
  exercises using two sets of sensors. Dynamic time warping analysis of the sensor
  signals suggested that the collected dataset could be used for further algorithm
  development. The findings demonstrate that the current iteration of MoJoXlab can
  perform movement analysis using quaternions from sensors of any manufacturer. However,
  the accuracy of the resulting joint angles is not yet suitable for clinical applications
  across all sensor types, and only Xsens and NGIMU sensors are currently supported.
  This study also explored the potential for reducing the number of sensors required
  by MoJoXlab, which currently uses seven sensors to calculate joint angles for three
  joints (hip, knee and ankle) on both sides of the body. The creation of a comprehensive
  databank for lower limb movement analysis algorithms was an additional outcome of
  this work. Further research and development are necessary to expand MoJoXlab's support
  for multiple sensor manufacturers and improve the accuracy of joint angle calculations
  for clinical applications.
