abstract: 'Background: Rehabilitation, or “prehabilitation,” is essential in preparing
  for and recovering from knee replacement surgery. The recent demand for these services
  has surpassed available resources, a situation further strained by the COVID-19
  pandemic, which has led to a pivot toward digital solutions such as web- or app-based
  videos and wearables. These solutions, however, face challenges with user engagement,
  calibration requirements, and skin contact issues. This study evaluated the practicality
  of a low-contact, gamified device designed to assist with prehabilitation exercises.
  Objective: The study aimed to assess the practicality and user-friendliness of a
  newly designed physiotherapy device (Slider) that enables exercise monitoring without
  the need for direct contact with the skin. Methods: A total of 17 patients awaiting
  knee replacement surgery at a UK National Health Service (NHS) hospital participated
  in this study. They used the device over a 2-week period and subsequently provided
  feedback through a usability and acceptability questionnaire. Results: The study
  was completed by all participants, with a majority (13/17, 76%) finding the device
  intuitive and easy to use. The majority of patients were satisfied with the device’s
  ability to meet their presurgery physiotherapy requirements (16/17, 94%) and expressed
  a willingness to continue using it (17/17, 100%). No safety issues or adverse effects
  were reported by the participants. Conclusions: The results indicate that the device
  was found to be a feasible option for patients to conduct presurgery physiotherapy
  exercises independently, away from a clinical setting. Further research involving
  a larger and more diverse group of participants is recommended to validate these
  findings more robustly.'
