abstract: 'textbfBackground: Rehabilitation, or “prehabilitation,” is essential in
  preparing for and recovering from knee replacement surgery. The recent demand for
  these services has surpassed available resources, a situation further strained by
  the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a pivot toward digital solutions such as
  web- or app-based videos and wearables. These solutions, however, face challenges
  with user engagement, calibration requirements, and skin contact issues. This study
  evaluated the practicality of a low-contact, gamified device designed to assist
  with prehabilitation exercises.textlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreatertextlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreater
  textbfObjective: The study aimed to assess the practicality and user-friendliness
  of a newly designed physiotherapy device (Slider) that enables exercise monitoring
  without the need for direct contact with the skin.textlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreatertextlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreater  textbfMethods:
  A total of 17 patients awaiting knee replacement surgery at a UK National Health
  Service (NHS) hospital participated in this study. They used the device over a 2-week
  period and subsequently provided feedback through a usability and acceptability
  questionnaire.textlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreatertextlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreater  textbfResults:The
  study was completed by all participants, with a majority (13/17, 76%) finding the
  device intuitive and easy to use. The majority of patients were satisfied with the
  device’s ability to meet their presurgery physiotherapy requirements (16/17, 94%)
  and expressed a willingness to continue using it (17/17, 100%). No safety issues
  or adverse effects were reported by the participants.textlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreatertextlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreater  textbfConclusions:
  The results indicate that the device was found to be a feasible option for patients
  to conduct presurgery physiotherapy exercises independently, away from a clinical
  setting. Further research involving a larger and more diverse group of participants
  is recommended to validate these findings more robustly.'
