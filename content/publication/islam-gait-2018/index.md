abstract: Background For people with neurological conditions such as stroke and brain
  injury, gait rehabilitation can lead to a significantly more independent lifestyle.
  Existing gait rehabilitation studies with stroke survivors using rhythmic haptic
  cueing via wearable devices have demonstrated improvements in temporal symmetry,
  increase in stride length and walking speed. However, these studies have been limited
  to laboratory settings and focused on short-term improvements only. By contrast,
  we present results from the first longitudinal case study on the self-managed use
  of wearable haptic devices for gait rehabilitation via entrainment in outdoor settings.  Methods
  A longitudinal pilot study was conducted with a brain injury survivor, providing
  rhythmic haptic cueing using a wearable haptic device for a two-week period. The
  participant was asked to walk in synchrony to the haptic rhythm at a suitable outdoor
  setting for a minimum of 10 minutes each day. Gait data was measured before and
  after the two-week intervention using lab-based IMU sensors.   Results On comparing
  the before and after gait characteristics, preliminary results showed improvement
  in temporal symmetry, walking speed and stride length.   Conclusions Implications
  for long-term benefits in gait rehabilitation using rhythmic haptic cueing for various
  neurological conditions are considered. Improvements in temporal symmetry, increase
  in stride length and walking speed could improve confidence, independence and overall
  quality of life for patients, with implications for reduction of costs associated
  with care and rehabilitation.
