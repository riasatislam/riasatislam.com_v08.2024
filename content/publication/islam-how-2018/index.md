abstract: 'Stroke is one of the leading causes for long-term adult disabilities. More
  than half of all stroke survivors depend on others for everyday activities after
  they are discharged from hospital. One of the conditions a stroke survivor may experience
  is hemiparetic gait. Typical characteristics of hemiparetic gait are: reduced speed,
  increased step variability, spatial and temporal asymmetry. These, in turn, lead
  to joint pain, bone degeneration, higher risk of falls, and fracture. To improve
  health and daily activities, rehabilitation, and physiotherapy is an integral part
  of the recovery plan. Rehabilitation is commonly performed in a clinical setting
  however this kind of long-term care is expensive. Therefore, reliable in-house rehabilitation
  techniques are highly desirable. In addition, there is evidence in the literature
  to suggest home-based rehabilitation is often more beneficial to the patients.  Numerous
  studies have shown rhythmic cueing as a promising technique for post-stroke gait
  rehabilitation. Auditory rhythmic cueing has shown improvement in gait patterns.
  Specifically, auditory cueing can assist with improvements in temporal and spatial
  symmetry, along with increases in walking speed, step and stride length. However,
  auditory cueing may be obstructive in an outdoor setting while trying to listen
  for alerts or having a conversation with others.  In such settings, haptic (touch
  based) cueing can be highly effective as means of covert, unobstructive rhythmic
  cueing. Recent studies have shown promising results for rhythmic haptic cueing using
  wearable haptic devices for post-stroke gait rehabilitation with improvement in
  temporal symmetry, increase in stride length and walking speed. This could improve
  confidence, independence and overall quality of life for the stroke survivors, with
  implications for reduction of costs associated with care and rehabilitation. Long-term
  benefits are yet to be determined empirically. Therefore, a longitudinal, in-the-wild
  pilot study, has been conducted with a single brain trauma survivor, providing rhythmic
  haptic cueing using a wearable haptic device. Gait characteristics have been analysed
  by comparing before and after in-lab measurements from a two-week intervention.
  This study aims to provide insights into potential long-term benefits of rhythmic
  haptic cueing for a range of neurological conditions affecting gait.'
