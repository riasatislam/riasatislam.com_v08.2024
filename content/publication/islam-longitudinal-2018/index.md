abstract: Introduction Improvement of gait is a high priority for hemiparetic stroke
  survivors. Auditory rhythmic cueing is a proven method for improving gait via entrainment
  but use is limited outside the lab. The lack of use in outdoor settings seems to
  reflect the problem that auditory cueing can be distracting and isolating out of
  doors, where survivors typically need to remain safe, aware of the environment.
  In such settings, haptic cueing offers an unobtrusive, invisible, sociable, safe
  alternative.  Research Question Existing studies have demonstrated improvements
  in temporal symmetry, increase in stride length and walking speed by means of post-stroke
  gait rehabilitation using wearable haptic devices in the lab. However, previous
  studies have been limited to laboratory settings and have focused on short-term
  improvements. By contrast, we present the first case study on the self-managed use
  of wearable haptics for gait rehabilitation via entrainment in outdoor settings,
  and the first findings from applying this technique over a number of days.  Methods
  A longitudinal pilot study was conducted with a single hemiparetic participant providing
  rhythmic haptic cueing using a wearable haptic device for a two-week period. The
  participant was asked to walk in synchrony to the haptic rhythm at a suitable outdoor
  setting for a minimum of 10 minutes each day. Gait data was measured before and
  after the two-week intervention using lab-based IMU sensors.  Results On comparing
  before and after gait characteristics, preliminary results showed substantial improvement
  in temporal symmetry and walking speed.  Conclusions There is implications for potential
  long-term benefits for stroke survivors in gait rehabilitation using rhythmic haptic
  cueing. Improvements in temporal symmetry, increase in stride length and walking
  speed could improve confidence, independence and overall quality of life for stroke
  survivors, with implications for reduction of costs associated with care and rehabilitation.
