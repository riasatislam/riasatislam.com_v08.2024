abstract: 'Background: Movement analysis in a clinical setting is frequently restricted
  to observational methods to inform clinical decision making, which has limited accuracy.
  Fixed-site, optical, expensive movement analysis laboratories provide gold standard
  kinematic measurements; however, they are rarely accessed for routine clinical use.
  Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) have been demonstrated as comparable,
  inexpensive, and portable movement analysis toolkits. MoJoXlab has therefore been
  developed to work with generic wearable IMUs. However, before using MoJoXlab in
  clinical practice, there is a need to establish its validity in participants with
  and without knee conditions across a range of tasks with varying complexity. Objective:
  This paper aimed to present the validation of MoJoXlab software for using generic
  wearable IMUs for calculating hip, knee, and ankle joint angle measurements in the
  sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes for walking, squatting, and jumping in
  healthy participants and those with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.
  Methods: Movement data were collected from 27 healthy participants and 20 participants
  with ACL reconstruction. In each case, the participants wore seven MTw2 IMUs (Xsens
  Technologies) to monitor their movement in walking, jumping, and squatting tasks.
  The hip, knee, and ankle joint angles were calculated in the sagittal, frontal,
  and transverse planes using two different software packages: Xsens’ validated proprietary
  MVN Analyze and MoJoXlab. The results were validated by comparing the generated
  waveforms, cross-correlation (CC), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE)
  values. Results: Across all joints and activities, for data of both healthy and
  ACL reconstruction participants, the CC and NRMSE values for the sagittal plane
  are 0.99 (SD 0.01) and 0.042 (SD 0.025); 0.88 (SD 0.048) and 0.18 (SD 0.078) for
  the frontal plane; and 0.85 (SD 0.027) and 0.23 (SD 0.065) for the transverse plane
  (hip and knee joints only). On comparing the results from the two different software
  systems, the sagittal plane was very highly correlated, with frontal and transverse
  planes showing strong correlation. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that nonproprietary
  software such as MoJoXlab can accurately calculate joint angles for movement analysis
  applications comparable with proprietary software for walking, squatting, and jumping
  in healthy individuals and those following ACL reconstruction. MoJoXlab can be used
  with generic wearable IMUs that can provide clinicians accurate objective data when
  assessing patients’ movement, even when changes are too small to be observed visually.
  The availability of easy-to-setup, nonproprietary software for calibration, data
  collection, and joint angle calculation has the potential to increase the adoption
  of wearable IMU sensors in clinical practice, as well as in free living conditions,
  and may provide wider access to accurate, objective assessment of patients’ progress
  over time.'
