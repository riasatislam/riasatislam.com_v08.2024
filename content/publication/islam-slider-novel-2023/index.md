abstract: textbfBackgroundtextlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreater The waiting
  times for total knee replacements are over six months in the UK, EU and Australia
  with many patients waiting over a year. This leads to significant deterioration
  in the quality of life and increased frailty. Although closely supervised pre-operative
  physiotherapy (Prehab) has been shown to partially mitigate this problem, the demand
  for physiotherapy services has outstripped the supply. This mismatch has been made
  worse by the recent Covid pandemic. Printed information, app-based videos and wearables
  have been introduced to compensate for this discrepancy. However, concerns remain
  about usability, lack of patient engagement, objective tracking of patient engagement,
  the need for calibration/special positioning, lack of force measurement, and complications
  arising from contact with the user’s skin. The latter especially so with wearables.
  A novel device, Slider®, was designed by patients, physiotherapists, and surgeons
  to address these 
  concerns.textlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreatertextlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreater   textbfObjectivestextlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreater
  A Real-World Validation (RWV), funded by the Lancashire Health MATTERS programme,
  which is part funded from European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) monies, evaluated
  the response of patients awaiting knee replacement surgery to the use of 
  Slider®.textlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreatertextlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreater   textbfStudy
  Design & Methodstextlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreater Slider® is a patented
  novel smart disc-shaped device 15cm in diameter with a force plate on its upper
  surface. A Lidar and optical sensors track heel motion in three dimensions. The
  force plate measures the downward force on the heel on Slider®, like that of a gait
  lab. The patient places their heel resting unrestricted on Slider®. As the patient
  moves their heel with Slider®, it tracks movements in the horizontal plane. When
  the heel is lifted off Slider® and its vertical position is tracked. Algorithms
  calculate the angle of knee flexion. The data is sent via Bluetooth to an app on
  the user’s smartphone/tablet. The app shows the user in real time how they are doing
  the exercises. Specially designed games actively encourage and record user engagement.
  Activity data is securely sent online in real time to the clinician. If the patient’s
  progress deviates from the pathway, an exception notification is sent to the patient
  and the clinician. 15 patients on the UK National Health Service (NHS) waiting list
  for knee replacements at a major teaching hospital were non-randomly chosen. They
  used the Slider® for two weeks and then completed an online questionnaire on usability
  and 
  acceptability.textlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreatertextlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreater   textbfResultstextlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreater
  73% found Slider® easy to learn to use. 93% of the patients were satisfied. 100%
  found that Slider® provided for their pre-operative physiotherapy needs. All agreed
  that they would use Slider® again. None of the patients had safety concerns or experienced
  adverse 
  effects.textlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreatertextlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreater   textbfConclusionstextlessbrtextgreatertextless/brtextgreater
  This Real World Validation was carried out on pre-operative patients with osteoarthritis
  of the knee. It has measured the usability and acceptability of Slider®. It established
  Slider® as an effective tool for patients having knee replacements to perform pre-operative
  physiotherapy exercises in a self-managed manner outside the hospital environment.
