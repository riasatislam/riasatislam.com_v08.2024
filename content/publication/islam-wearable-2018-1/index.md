abstract: Many people with long-term neurological and neurodegenerative conditions
  such as stroke, brain injury, multiple sclerosis or Parkinsonâ€™s disease suffer from
  an impaired walking gait pattern. Gait improvement can lead to better fluidity in
  walking, improved health outcomes, greater independence, and enhanced quality of
  life. Existing lab-based studies with wearable haptic devices have shown that rhythmic
  haptic cueing can cause immediate improvements to gait features such as temporal
  symmetry, stride length and walking speed. However, such wearable haptic devices
  are unsuitable for self-managed use, and to move this approach from out of the lab
  into long-term sustained usage, numerous design challenges need to be addressed.
  We are designing, developing, and testing a closed-loop system to provide adaptive
  haptic rhythmic cues for sustainable self-managed long-term use outside the lab
  by survivors of stroke, and other neurological conditions, in their everyday lives.
