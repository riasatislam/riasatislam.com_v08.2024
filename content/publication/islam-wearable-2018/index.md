abstract: This research explores the development and evaluation of wearable haptic
  devices for gait sensing and rhythmic haptic cueing in the context of gait re-education
  for people with neurological and neurodegenerative conditions. Many people with
  long-term neurological and neurodegenerative conditions such as Stroke, Brain Injury,
  Multiple Sclerosis or Parkinsonâ€™s disease suffer from impaired walking gait pattern.
  Gait improvement can lead to better fluidity in walking, improved health outcomes,
  greater independence, and enhanced quality of life. Existing lab-based studies with
  wearable devices have shown that rhythmic haptic cueing can cause immediate improvements
  to gait features such as temporal symmetry, stride length, and walking speed. However,
  current wearable systems are unsuitable for self-managed use for in-the-wild applications
  with people having such conditions. This work aims to investigate the research question
  of how wearable haptic devices can help in long-term gait re-education using rhythmic
  haptic cueing. A longitudinal pilot study has been conducted with a brain trauma
  survivor, providing rhythmic haptic cueing using a wearable haptic device as a therapeutic
  intervention for a two-week period. Preliminary results comparing pre and post-intervention
  gait measurements have shown improvements in walking speed, temporal asymmetry,
  and stride length. The pilot study has raised an array of issues that require further
  study. This work aims to develop and evaluate prototype systems through an iterative
  design process to make possible the self-managed use of such devices in-the-wild.
  These systems will directly provide therapeutic intervention for gait re-education,
  offer enhanced information for therapists, remotely monitor dosage adherence and
  inform treatment and prognoses over the long-term. This research will evaluate the
  use of technology from the perspective of multiple stakeholders, including clinicians,
  carers and patients. This work has the potential to impact clinical practice nationwide
  and worldwide in neuro-physiotherapy.
