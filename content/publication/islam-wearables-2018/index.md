abstract: Many people with long-term neurological and neurodegenerative conditions
  such as stroke, brain injury, multiple sclerosis or Parkinsonâ€™s disease suffer from
  an impaired walking gait pattern. Gait improvement can lead to better fluidity in
  walking, improved health outcomes, greater independence, and enhanced quality of
  life. Existing lab-based studies with wearable devices have shown that rhythmic
  haptic cueing can cause immediate improvements to gait features such as temporal
  symmetry, stride length and walking speed. However, current wearable systems are
  unsuitable for self-managed use, and to move this approach from out of the lab into
  long-term sustained usage, numerous design challenges need to be addressed. We are
  designing, developing, and testing a closed-loop system to provide adaptive haptic
  rhythmic cues for sustainable self-managed long-term use outside the lab by survivors
  of stroke, and other neurological conditions, in their everyday lives.
