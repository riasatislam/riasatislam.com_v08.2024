abstract: We evaluated contemporary Islamic lifestyle applications supporting religious
  practices and motivation among Muslims. We reviewed 11 popular applications using
  self-determination theory and the technology-as-experience framework to assess their
  support for motivation and affective needs. Most applications lack features that
  foster autonomy, competence, and relatedness. We also interviewed ten devoted Muslim
  application users to gain insights into their experiences and unmet needs. Our findings
  indicate that existing applications fall short in providing comprehensive learning,
  social connections, and scholar consultations. We propose design implications based
  on our results, including guided religious information, shareability, virtual community
  engagement, scholarly question-answering, and personalized reminders. We aim to
  inform the design of Islamic lifestyle applications that better facilitate ritual
  practices, benefitting application designers and Muslim communities. Our research
  provides valuable insights into the untapped potential for lifestyle applications
  to act as religious companions supporting Muslims' spiritual journey.
