abstract: Depletion of fossil fuel and the inability to meet the rising demand of
  electricity are some drawbacks for the economic development of Bangladesh. Carbon
  emission done by developed world is also troubling the country. This paper focuses
  on the potential of micro-hydropower plant in Bangladesh due to its numerous rivers
  and canals providing off-grid power to the remote areas and also to the areas that
  are still outside the main grid network. This paper reflects on the current energy
  scenario in Bangladesh, the need to explore green energy thus proving how the establishment
  of widespread micro-hydropower plant can help overcome the current power crisis
  and play a role in the economic progress of the country. The existing potential
  sites are mentioned and the means to identify new sites are outlined by performing
  hydrology studies, topographic studies, head calculations, turbine selection, and
  so forth.
