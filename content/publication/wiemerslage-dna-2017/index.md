abstract: We investigated five methylation markers recently linked to body mass index,
  for their role in the neuropathology of obesity. In neuroimaging experiments, our
  analysis involving 23 participants showed that methylation levels for the cg07814318
  site, which lies within the KLF13 gene, correlated with brain activity in the claustrum,
  putamen, cingulate gyrus and frontal gyri, some of which have been previously associated
  to food signaling, obesity or reward. Methylation levels at cg07814318 also positively
  correlated with ghrelin levels. Moreover, expression of KLF13 was augmented in the
  brains of obese and starved mice. Our results suggest the cg07814318 site could
  be involved in orexigenic processes, and also implicate KLF13 in obesity. Our findings
  are the first to associate methylation levels in blood with brain activity in obesity-related
  regions, and further support previous findings between ghrelin, brain activity and
  genetic differences.
