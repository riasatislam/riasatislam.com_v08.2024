	abstract = {Global warming has become the greatest problem of the world in the last few decades. Many efforts have already been made in some international treaties, but due to many limitations the success achieved so far is very minimal. The whole civilization depends on industrialization, which is making the environmental scenario worse day by day because of unavailability of green technology. Industrialization is important but Trading off between the carbon emission reduction and industrialization is more challenging task in hand. Though the developing nations are less industrialized and emitting less carbon, but they are suffering more for environmental degradation. The whole world has seen the developing nations being victimized by the tsunami disaster recently. To fight this situation, the whole world is looking for sustainable green technology in all sectors. This paper presents an idea of installing more nuclear power plants in developing nations to reduce carbon emission. Technical feasibility of building nuclear power plants has been proved and prioritizing energy sector over other sectors to implement green technology has been justified. Economic feasibility of the proposal has also been proved from the statistics and global governance and monitoring system has been proposed to overcome global skepticism about building nuclear power plants.},

In neuroimaging experiments, our analysis involving 23 participants showed that methylation levels for the cg07814318 site, which lies within the KLF13 gene, correlated with brain activity in the claustrum, putamen, cingulate gyrus and frontal gyri, some of which have been previously associated to food signaling, obesity or reward. Methylation levels at cg07814318 also positively correlated with ghrelin levels. Moreover, expression of KLF13 was augmented in the brains of obese and starved mice. Our results suggest the cg07814318 site could be involved in orexigenic processes, and also implicate KLF13 in obesity. Our findings are the first to associate methylation levels in blood with brain activity in obesity-related regions, and further support previous findings between ghrelin, brain activity and genetic differences.},

	abstract = {In a multi-disciplinary project, patient derived glioblastoma stem-cell cultures (GSCs) have been established and characterized extensively with the goal of applying computational efforts to integrate results from high-throughput screens of drugs and RNAi with genomic and transcriptional profiling to predict the most successful therapy for individual glioma patients. The main goal of this study was to develop a platform for testing the tumor-initiating capacity of GSCs in mouse brain and to label the cells with GFP-luciferase to enable non-invasive quantification of tumor growth by in vivo bioluminescence imaging. Adherently grown GFP-luciferase labeled glioblastoma stem-cell cultures were dissociated and injected stereotactically into immunodeficient mice. Tumor growth was monitored by IVIS imaging for up to 40 weeks and brains were collected for histopathological and immunohistochemical stainings. Automatic quantification and growth pattern analysis of tumor cells in brain sections was set up based on human cell specific staining and a CellProfiler Analyst’s machine learning classifier with a manual observer correlation of 0.86. GSC xenograft tumors with a wide range of histopathological features and biological behaviors recapitulating high grade astrocytoma was confirmed in mice injected with 14 of the 29 glioblastoma cell cultures (48\%). Glial lineage markers, such as Sox2, GFAP, and Olig2, were expressed both in patient tumors and patient derived xenografts. Individual glioblastoma cell cultures were either characterized by formation of condensed tumors (8/14, 57\%) or diffuse infiltrative growth through the brain parenchyma (6/14, 43\%). In summary, we present a valuable mouse model for preclinical studies of glioma. Integrative analysis of molecular profiles with growth pattern data has the potential to unravel genes that distinguish tumors with more infiltrative growth. Our biobank of luciferase labeled GSCs may be useful for longitudinal monitoring of tumor growth dynamics in the setting of therapies and provides a foundation for testing the effect of predicted drug vulnerabilites in orthotopic xenografts mouse models.Citation Format: Cecilia Krona, Soumi Kundu, Karl Holmberg-Olausson, Riasat Islam, Rashmi Ramachandra, Ludmila Elfineh, Sven Nelander.

	abstract = {Background
For people with neurological conditions such as stroke and brain injury, gait rehabilitation can lead to a significantly more independent lifestyle. Existing gait rehabilitation studies with stroke survivors using rhythmic haptic cueing via wearable devices have demonstrated improvements in temporal symmetry, increase in stride length and walking speed. However, these studies have been limited to laboratory settings and focused on short-term improvements only. By contrast, we present results from the first longitudinal case study on the self-managed use of wearable haptic devices for gait rehabilitation via entrainment in outdoor settings.

Methods
A longitudinal pilot study was conducted with a brain injury survivor, providing rhythmic haptic cueing using a wearable haptic device for a two-week period. The participant was asked to walk in synchrony to the haptic rhythm at a suitable outdoor setting for a minimum of 10 minutes each day. Gait data was measured before and after the two-week intervention using lab-based IMU sensors. 

Results
On comparing the before and after gait characteristics, preliminary results showed improvement in temporal symmetry, walking speed and stride length. 

Conclusions
Implications for long-term benefits in gait rehabilitation using rhythmic haptic cueing for various neurological conditions are considered. Improvements in temporal symmetry, increase in stride length and walking speed could improve confidence, independence and overall quality of life for patients, with implications for reduction of costs associated with care and rehabilitation.},

	copyright = {cc\_by\_nc\_nd\_4},
	url = {https://oro.open.ac.uk/53032/},
	abstract = {Introduction
Improvement of gait is a high priority for hemiparetic stroke survivors. Auditory rhythmic cueing is a proven method for improving gait via entrainment but use is limited outside the lab. The lack of use in outdoor settings seems to reflect the problem that auditory cueing can be distracting and isolating out of doors, where survivors typically need to remain safe, aware of the environment. In such settings, haptic cueing offers an unobtrusive, invisible, sociable, safe alternative.

Research Question
Existing studies have demonstrated improvements in temporal symmetry, increase in stride length and walking speed by means of post-stroke gait rehabilitation using wearable haptic devices in the lab. However, previous studies have been limited to laboratory settings and have focused on short-term improvements. By contrast, we present the first case study on the self-managed use of wearable haptics for gait rehabilitation via entrainment in outdoor settings, and the first findings from applying this technique over a number of days.

Methods
A longitudinal pilot study was conducted with a single hemiparetic participant providing rhythmic haptic cueing using a wearable haptic device for a two-week period. The participant was asked to walk in synchrony to the haptic rhythm at a suitable outdoor setting for a minimum of 10 minutes each day. Gait data was measured before and after the two-week intervention using lab-based IMU sensors.

Results
On comparing before and after gait characteristics, preliminary results showed substantial improvement in temporal symmetry and walking speed.

Conclusions
There is implications for potential long-term benefits for stroke survivors in gait rehabilitation using rhythmic haptic cueing. Improvements in temporal symmetry, increase in stride length and walking speed could improve confidence, independence and overall quality of life for stroke survivors, with implications for reduction of costs associated with care and rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {Stroke is one of the leading causes for long-term adult disabilities. More than half of all stroke survivors depend on others for everyday activities after they are discharged from hospital. One of the conditions a stroke survivor may experience is hemiparetic gait. Typical characteristics of hemiparetic gait are: reduced speed, increased step variability, spatial and temporal asymmetry. These, in turn, lead to joint pain, bone degeneration, higher risk of falls, and fracture. To improve health and daily activities, rehabilitation, and physiotherapy is an integral part of the recovery plan. Rehabilitation is commonly performed in a clinical setting however this kind of long-term care is expensive. Therefore, reliable in-house rehabilitation techniques are highly desirable. In addition, there is evidence in the literature to suggest home-based rehabilitation is often more beneficial to the patients.

Numerous studies have shown rhythmic cueing as a promising technique for post-stroke gait rehabilitation. Auditory rhythmic cueing has shown improvement in gait patterns. Specifically, auditory cueing can assist with improvements in temporal and spatial symmetry, along with increases in walking speed, step and stride length. However, auditory cueing may be obstructive in an outdoor setting while trying to listen for alerts or having a conversation with others.

In such settings, haptic (touch based) cueing can be highly effective as means of covert, unobstructive rhythmic cueing. Recent studies have shown promising results for rhythmic haptic cueing using wearable haptic devices for post-stroke gait rehabilitation with improvement in temporal symmetry, increase in stride length and walking speed. This could improve confidence, independence and overall quality of life for the stroke survivors, with implications for reduction of costs associated with care and rehabilitation. Long-term benefits are yet to be determined empirically. Therefore, a longitudinal, in-the-wild pilot study, has been conducted with a single brain trauma survivor, providing rhythmic haptic cueing using a wearable haptic device. Gait characteristics have been analysed by comparing before and after in-lab measurements from a two-week intervention. This study aims to provide insights into potential long-term benefits of rhythmic haptic cueing for a range of neurological conditions affecting gait.},

Many people with long-term neurological and neurodegenerative conditions such as Stroke, Brain Injury, Multiple Sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease suffer from impaired walking gait pattern.

Existing lab-based studies with wearable devices have shown that rhythmic haptic cueing can cause immediate improvements to gait features such as temporal symmetry, stride length, and walking speed.

This work aims to investigate the research question of how wearable haptic devices can help in long-term gait re-education using rhythmic haptic cueing. A longitudinal pilot study has been conducted with a brain trauma survivor, providing rhythmic haptic cueing using a wearable haptic device as a therapeutic intervention for a two-week period. Preliminary results comparing pre and post-intervention gait measurements have shown improvements in walking speed, temporal asymmetry, and stride length. The pilot study has raised an array of issues that require further study. This work aims to develop and evaluate prototype systems through an iterative design process to make possible the self-managed use of such devices in-the-wild. These systems will directly provide therapeutic intervention for gait re-education, offer enhanced information for therapists, remotely monitor dosage adherence and inform treatment and prognoses over the long-term. This research will evaluate the use of technology from the perspective of multiple stakeholders, including clinicians, carers and patients.

	abstract = {MoJoXlabMoJoXlab is a MATLAB based custom motion capture analysis software toolkit whose aim is to produce freely available motion capture analysis software to be used by anyone interested in generating lower limb joint kinematics waveforms using any suitable wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs).It can generate joint angles of Ankle, Hip and Knee joints in Sagittal, Frontal and Transverse (not available for Ankle joint) planes for different functional tasks such as walking, squatting, and jumping. The joint kinematics for MoJoXlab is based on Joint Coordinate System (JCS) as proposed by Grood and Suntay. MoJoXlab takes sensor orientation data in quaternions as input and outputs joint angles in degrees. The algorithm considers a static calibration step, where sensor data is captured for calibration purposes while the participant maintains a standing pose. This calibration step is then used to calculate the joint angles for the dynamic phase of the motion.Data StructureCurrently, MoJoXlab is designed to be used on a 7 sensor based setup, with sensors placed in the Pelvis, both thighs, both shanks and both feet. Input files should be in quaternions for 7 sensors with 28 columns of data in the following order, where each sensor consists of 4 columns of quaternion orientations:Pelvis [qa, qb, qc, qd],Right Thigh [qa, qb, qc, qd], Right Shank [qa, qb, qc, qd],Right Foot [qa, qb, qc, qd], Left Thigh [qa, qb, qc, qd], Left Shank [qa, qb, qc, qd], Left Foot [qa, qb, qc, qd].Output files will contain joint angles with 16 columns of data in the following order:Ankle Left Sagittal,Ankle Left Frontal,Ankle Right Sagittal, Ankle Right Frontal, Hip Left Sagittal,Hip Left Frontal, Hip Left Transverse, Hip Right Sagittal, Hip Right Frontal, Hip Right Transverse, Knee Left Sagittal, Knee Left Frontal, Knee Left Transverse, Knee Right Sagittal, Knee Right Frontal, Knee Right Transverse.

	abstract = {Background: Movement analysis in a clinical setting is frequently restricted to observational methods to inform clinical decision making, which has limited accuracy. Fixed-site, optical, expensive movement analysis laboratories provide gold standard kinematic measurements; however, they are rarely accessed for routine clinical use. Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) have been demonstrated as comparable, inexpensive, and portable movement analysis toolkits. MoJoXlab has therefore been developed to work with generic wearable IMUs. However, before using MoJoXlab in clinical practice, there is a need to establish its validity in participants with and without knee conditions across a range of tasks with varying complexity.
Objective: This paper aimed to present the validation of MoJoXlab software for using generic wearable IMUs for calculating hip, knee, and ankle joint angle measurements in the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes for walking, squatting, and jumping in healthy participants and those with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.
Methods: Movement data were collected from 27 healthy participants and 20 participants with ACL reconstruction. In each case, the participants wore seven MTw2 IMUs (Xsens Technologies) to monitor their movement in walking, jumping, and squatting tasks. The hip, knee, and ankle joint angles were calculated in the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes using two different software packages: Xsens’ validated proprietary MVN Analyze and MoJoXlab. The results were validated by comparing the generated waveforms, cross-correlation (CC), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values.
Results: Across all joints and activities, for data of both healthy and ACL reconstruction participants, the CC and NRMSE values for the sagittal plane are 0.99 (SD 0.01) and 0.042 (SD 0.025); 0.88 (SD 0.048) and 0.18 (SD 0.078) for the frontal plane; and 0.85 (SD 0.027) and 0.23 (SD 0.065) for the transverse plane (hip and knee joints only). On comparing the results from the two different software systems, the sagittal plane was very highly correlated, with frontal and transverse planes showing strong correlation.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that nonproprietary software such as MoJoXlab can accurately calculate joint angles for movement analysis applications comparable with proprietary software for walking, squatting, and jumping in healthy individuals and those following ACL reconstruction. MoJoXlab can be used with generic wearable IMUs that can provide clinicians accurate objective data when assessing patients’ movement, even when changes are too small to be observed visually. The availability of easy-to-setup, nonproprietary software for calibration, data collection, and joint angle calculation has the potential to increase the adoption of wearable IMU sensors in clinical practice, as well as in free living conditions, and may provide wider access to accurate, objective assessment of patients’ progress over time.},

	abstract = {Background: Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited genetic disorder that results in the death of brain cells. HD symptoms generally start with subtle changes in mood and mental abilities; they then degenerate progressively, ensuing a general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait, ultimately resulting in death. There is currently no cure for HD. Walking cued by an external, usually auditory, rhythm has been shown to steady gait and help with movement coordination in other neurological conditions. More recently, work with other neurological conditions has demonstrated that haptic (ie, tactile) rhythmic cues, as opposed to audio cues, offer similar improvements when walking. An added benefit is that less intrusive, more private cues are delivered by a wearable device that leaves the ears free for conversation, situation awareness, and safety. This paper presents a case study where rhythmic haptic cueing (RHC) was applied to one person with HD. The case study has two elements:  the gait data we collected from our wearable devices and the comments we received from a group of highly trained expert physiotherapists and specialists in HD.
Objective: The objective of this case study was to investigate whether RHC can be applied to improve gait coordination and limb control in people living with HD. While not offering a cure, therapeutic outcomes may delay the onset or severity of symptoms, with the potential to improve and prolong quality of life.
Methods: The approach adopted for this study includes two elements, one quantitative and one qualitative. The first is a repeated-measures design with three conditions: before haptic rhythm (ie, baseline), with haptic rhythm, and after exposure to haptic rhythm. The second element is an in-depth interview with physiotherapists observing the session.
Results: In comparison to the baseline, the physiotherapists noted a number of improvements to the participant’s kinematics during her walk with the haptic cues. These improvements continued in the after-cue condition, indicating some lasting effects. The quantitative data obtained support the physiotherapists’ observations.
Conclusions: The findings from this small case study, with a single participant, suggest that a haptic metronomic rhythm may have immediate, potentially therapeutic benefits for the walking kinematics of people living with HD and warrants further investigation.},

	abstract = {\textbf{Background}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater}
The waiting times for total knee replacements are over six months in the UK, EU and Australia with many patients waiting over a year. This leads to significant deterioration in the quality of life and increased frailty. Although closely supervised pre-operative physiotherapy (Prehab) has been shown to partially mitigate this problem, the demand for physiotherapy services has outstripped the supply. This mismatch has been made worse by the recent Covid pandemic. Printed information, app-based videos and wearables have been introduced to compensate for this discrepancy. However, concerns remain about usability, lack of patient engagement, objective tracking of patient engagement, the need for calibration/special positioning, lack of force measurement, and complications arising from contact with the user’s skin. The latter especially so with wearables. A novel device, Slider®, was designed by patients, physiotherapists, and surgeons to address these concerns.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater}


\textbf{Objectives}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater}
A Real-World Validation (RWV), funded by the Lancashire Health MATTERS programme, which is part funded from European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) monies, evaluated the response of patients awaiting knee replacement surgery to the use of Slider®.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater}


\textbf{Study Design \& Methods}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater}
Slider® is a patented novel smart disc-shaped device 15cm in diameter with a force plate on its upper surface. A Lidar and optical sensors track heel motion in three dimensions. The force plate measures the downward force on the heel on Slider®, like that of a gait lab. The patient places their heel resting unrestricted on Slider®. As the patient moves their heel with Slider®, it tracks movements in the horizontal plane. When the heel is lifted off Slider® and its vertical position is tracked. Algorithms calculate the angle of knee flexion. The data is sent via Bluetooth to an app on the user’s smartphone/tablet. The app shows the user in real time how they are doing the exercises. Specially designed games actively encourage and record user engagement. Activity data is securely sent online in real time to the clinician. If the patient’s progress deviates from the pathway, an exception notification is sent to the patient and the clinician. 15 patients on the UK National Health Service (NHS) waiting list for knee replacements at a major teaching hospital were non-randomly chosen. They used the Slider® for two weeks and then completed an online questionnaire on usability and acceptability.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater}


\textbf{Results}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater}
73\% found Slider® easy to learn to use. 93\% of the patients were satisfied. 100\% found that Slider® provided for their pre-operative physiotherapy needs. All agreed that they would use Slider® again. None of the patients had safety concerns or experienced adverse effects.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater}


\textbf{Conclusions}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater}
This Real World Validation was carried out on pre-operative patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. It has measured the usability and acceptability of Slider®. It established Slider® as an effective tool for patients having knee replacements to perform pre-operative physiotherapy exercises in a self-managed manner outside the hospital environment.},

	abstract = {Aims
This paper draws on emergent findings of a UKRI-funded project (SENSE, EP/V042351/1) focusing on touch as a prime locus for children to explore the natural environment in their school grounds. With recognition of the decreasing levels of children’s exposure to the outdoors, this project critically explores the integration of two modes of touch (digital, natural) for children to make sense of and articulate their lived experiences. 

Methods
We conducted observations involving 302 children aged 6-12 across 10 primary schools in Scotland and England. Activities involved children using touch to explore natural objects (e.g. feathers, pinecones, leaves); interacting with new digital haptic (touch) technologies featuring textures from nature (e.g. tree barks, fur, scales); engaging in arts activities and exploring scientific questions around texture (e.g. why are some tree barks rough and others smooth?). Data were collected through photos, audio and video recordings, and observation notes. 

Main Findings
Emergent findings point to the complex and significant role of touch in integrating children’s exploration of the natural world with their communication and imaginative abilities. Evidence shows children using touch to make sense of familiar and unknown objects in new ways, supported by hand and facial gestures and the use of metaphorical language furthering new observations and new questions.

Conclusions
We argue that a focus on touch discloses the opportunities for children to develop personal connections with their environment and stimulate further inquiry. Drawing further attention to the significance of digital and natural touch as modes of learning in sustainability education, the (school) environment is offered as a ‘place’ for all children both to learn and belong.},

	abstract = {At the heart of the current environmental crisis lies arguably a wider crisis, our loss of ability to perceive ourselves as part of an interconnected living world (Kimmerer, 2013). We contend that, counterintuitively, the digital touchscreens that captivate our children can also help reconnect them with nature. To this purpose, we designed digital haptic experiences for embodied interactions that prime affective dispositions towards the natural world.  

Part of a UKRI-funded project (SENSE, EP/V042351/1), the study involved 302 children aged 6-12 across 10 primary schools in England and Scotland. Focusing on tactile feedback, indoor activities included direct tactile exploration of natural objects (e.g., feathers, pinecones, leaves) and digital haptic exploration of textures from nature (e.g., tree barks, fur, scales) via newly designed haptic interfaces. These were followed up with outdoor touch-based activities, e.g., designing creatures from clay and natural materials scavenged from the school grounds to observe how textures may be adapted for life within those grounds. Data were collected through photos, audio and video recordings, and observation notes.  

Across the study, we found children using touch to make sense of both familiar and unfamiliar objects in new ways, supported by hand and facial gestures, evoking affective memories and leading to new observations and questions. Without prior priming, results also pointed to the complex and significant role of digital haptics in integrating children’s exploration of textures  with their communication and imaginative abilities, e.g., expressed through the use of over 100 distinct metaphors and 100 tactile adjectives, that naturally led to further scientific questions (e.g. why are some tree barks rough and others smooth; why are bumblebees furry and why do they buzz?).  

We argue that a focus on touch discloses the opportunities for attentionality – as the capacity to ‘pay attention’ – through the intermodality of touch and vision, for “one can literally see with the hands and touch with the eyes” (Paterson, 2007). Emphasising digital and natural touch in science education can thus supports interconnectedness with nature and learning about sustainability. In this context, the school environment is offered as a ‘place’ for all children both to learn and belong (Kimmerer, 2013).},

Data were collected from 15 healthy participants who performed a range of clinically relevant activities and exercises using two sets of sensors. Dynamic time warping analysis of the sensor signals suggested that the collected dataset could be used for further algorithm development. The findings demonstrate that the current iteration of MoJoXlab can perform movement analysis using quaternions from sensors of any manufacturer. However, the accuracy of the resulting joint angles is not yet suitable for clinical applications across all sensor types, and only Xsens and NGIMU sensors are currently supported. This study also explored the potential for reducing the number of sensors required by MoJoXlab, which currently uses seven sensors to calculate joint angles for three joints (hip, knee and ankle) on both sides of the body. The creation of a comprehensive databank for lower limb movement analysis algorithms was an additional outcome of this work. Further research and development are necessary to expand MoJoXlab's support for multiple sensor manufacturers and improve the accuracy of joint angle calculations for clinical applications.},
